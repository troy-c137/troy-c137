### Hey there, my name is Troy! 
### I'm mainly interested in developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, the cloud environment, and cybersecurity, but I also have interests in the world of simulations and using graphics to represent real-world problems and the possible solutions to those problems. 
### I'm currently working on mastering Java and its applications, but afterwards I plan on gaining proficiency in Kotlin, Python, JS, C++ and a few other languages depending on what I'm working on at the time. 
### Over time, I'll be posting the programs I work on in whether they're derived from personal projects or ideas I gain from problems in my classes at school. Either way, I'm always open to feedback no matter what it may be, so if you see a way I can improve my code, then please let me know!
