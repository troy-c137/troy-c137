### Hey there, my name is Troy! 
### I have a wide variety of interests, but I love to learn about developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, the cloud environment, cybersecurity, human-computer interfaces, and robotics.
### I'm currently working as a Full Stack Software Engineer for MSPCFO, a financial data analytics platform.
### On the side, I'm developing my personal website and developing other projects to practically apply my always developing skill set.
### Over time, I'll be posting the projects I work on, whether they're derived from personal projects, tasks from work, or ideas I gain from problems in my classes at school. I'm always open to feedback no matter what it may be, so if you see a way I can improve my code, then please let me know! 
### Also, I'd love to help contribute to any open-source software that you have, so please send it my way!

Please send any business-related or open-source collab inquiries to: troyc137@gmail.com
