### Hey there, my name is Troy! 
### I have a wide variety of interests, but I love to focus in on developments in artificial intelligence, machine learning, the cloud environment, cybersecurity, human-computer interfaces, and robotics. Ultimately, I'm working to gain an effective mastery in these technologies to find real-world solutions to real-world problems. 
### I'm currently working as a Software Engineer for MSPCFO, a financial data analytics platform. Additionally, I'm working on mastering Java and its applications, but afterwards I plan on gaining proficiency in Python, JS, C++ and a few other languages depending on what I'm working on at the time. 
### Over time, I'll be posting the programs I work on in whether they're derived from personal projects, tasks from work, or ideas I gain from problems in my classes at school. Either way, I'm always open to feedback no matter what it may be, so if you see a way I can improve my code, then please let me know! 
### Also, I'd love to help contribute to any open-source software that you have, so please send it my way!

Please send any business-related or open-source collab inquiries to: troyc137@gmail.com
